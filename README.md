# Process
- IEM measurements use a clone IEC711 coupler
- Headphone measurements (coming soon) use a pair of KB501X pinnae, a clone IEC711 coupler and [Capra Audio's 3D printed stand](https://www.printables.com/model/506860-iec711-stand)
- I align the 8kHz resonance peak of the coupler on all measurements where possible
- I use [REW](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) on Windows and MacOS and [AudioTools](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/audiotools-db-sound-audio/id325307477) on iOS
